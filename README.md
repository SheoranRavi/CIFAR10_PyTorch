# CIFAR10_PyTorch
A CNN model trained on CIFAR-10 in PyTorch. Accuracy on test set: ~87%

## File Description
CIFAR10_PyTorch: Trains and saves the model
checkpoint_save: Saved model state_dict 
Predicting labels for test set: Running the model on batches in test set

## Future Work
Visualize the trained layers
